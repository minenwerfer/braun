# Braun
>Serve icons over network for your frontend project

## Introduction

Braun is a lightweight Webpack loader that makes it possible to serve icons statically on demand. It searches for icons names in modules source code and moves them to a static folder during the build time. All design credits goes to [Iconscout](https://github.com/iconscout/unicons).

## Advantages

- It doesn't reflect on bundle size
- You don't have to move all icons at once
- Direct referencing icons makes browser caching better
- Icons are inline SVGs, so you can modify them as you want

## Credits
This project was inspired by [Vue Unicons](https://github.com/antonreshetov/vue-unicons). The icons itself were designed by [Iconscout](https://github.com/iconscout/unicons).
